# EBM-Note-Templates

Open-source repository of evidence-based clinical note templates to improve patient care and physician productivity.

## Mission

Our mission is to create a collaborative, open-source repository of standardized clinical note templates that are clear, comprehensive, and based on current clinical guidelines. Poorly structured notes can lead to critical information being missed, wasted physician time, and hindered data analysis for quality improvement. By providing evidence-based templates, we aim to enhance patient care, support shared decision-making, and increase physician efficiency.

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from clinicians, researchers, and healthcare professionals who are passionate about improving clinical documentation.

### How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch for your template.
2. **Create an Issue** to propose a new template or suggest improvements to existing ones.
3. **Develop the template** following the format specified below.
4. **Submit a Pull Request** with a clear description linking to the relevant issue.
5. **Request review** from other contributors or maintainers.

### Template Format

All templates should be written in Markdown and follow the **SOAP** (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) structure, with additional sub-prompts based on clinical guidelines.

#### Required Sections:

- **Subjective**: Patient-reported history, symptoms, concerns, and social history.
  - Include prompts for relevant history, review of systems, and patient goals.
- **Objective**: Measurable data, physical exam findings, lab results, imaging.
  - Include prompts for vital signs, exam findings, and diagnostic results.
- **Assessment**: Clinical impressions, differential diagnoses, and problem list.
  - Include prompts for evidence-based diagnostic criteria and risk stratification.
- **Plan**: Management steps, medications, referrals, patient education, follow-up.
  - Include prompts for guideline-recommended interventions and shared decision-making.

#### Additional Guidelines:

- Use bullet points or checklists for easy completion.
- Include references to clinical guidelines (e.g., AHA/ACC, USPSTF, specialty society).
- Ensure templates are concise, actionable, and adaptable to different clinical settings.
- Avoid proprietary or institution-specific terminology to maintain broad usability.
